Why are some tissues capable of full regeneration after injury and others are not?
Some tissues like epithelium have high regenerative capacity due to presence of stem cells while others like neurons have limited regenerative capacity.

Why are some cells not capable of mitosis (cellular division)?
Some cells like neurons exit the cell cycle permanently and cannot divide due to absence of centrioles.

Why is it imperative that only the proper intravenous (IV) solutions be given?
It is imperative to give proper IV solutions to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and avoid complications.

Why is membrane physiology of the brain unique in the development of drugs?
Unique membrane physiology of brain poses a challenge for drug permeability via blood-brain barrier.

Why does cancer and mitosis have so much in common?
Cancer and mitosis share unchecked cell proliferation due to mutations in cell cycle regulation.

Why are stem cells considered controversial?
Stem cells are controversial due to ethical concerns about embryonic stem cell sources.

Why are cadaver tissue transplants important?
Cadaver tissue helps meet transplant needs and advance research with donated human tissues.

Why do cells and tissues age?
Cells and tissues age due to telomere shortening, cellular senescence, and depleted stem cell pools.
